\begin{abstract}
If $n$ is a multiple of 4, then a square of side $n$ can be tiled with T-tetrominos, using a well-known construction. If $n$ is even but not a multiple of four, then there exists an equally well-known construction for tiling a square of side $n$ with T-tetrominos and exactly 4 monominos.
It was shown by Walkup in \cite{walkup} that it is not possible to tile the square using only T-tetrominos. Now consider the remaining cases, where $n$ is odd. It was shown by ?? in \cite{who?} that it is not possible to tile a square using only one monomino. ?? showed in \cite{??} that no more than 9 monominos are ever needed. We give a construction for all odd $n$ which uses exactly 5 monominos, thereby resolving the question. ?? also conjectured that no more than 5 monominos are needed for any rectangle, with rectangles with odd height and odd width the only possibility for a counter-example. Our construction can also be used for certain classes of such rectangles, and reduces the spaces of possible counter-examples.
